# OpenVDMv2-PortOffice v2.2
OpenVDMv2 - Port Office is the shore-side component of OpenVDMv2.  It's purpose is to provide shore-side personnel with a elegant interface and rich end-user experience to the data managed by OpenVDMv2.  This includes access to the data visualizations, maps, data quality test results and data file statistics.

In addition to showing these insights into the current cruise, OpenVDMv2 - Port Office can also show users the same information from previous cruises, allowing users to discover trends in sensor performance.

As with OpenVDMv2, Port Office also includes a full RESTful API, allowing vessel operators to built their own custom web-based and stand-alone applications that leverage information stored within OpenVDMv2 - Port Office for their own, vessel-specific needs.

## Thanks and acknowledgments ##

OpenVDMv2 - PortOffice has been made possible largely by the generosity of the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) who have continuously donated to the project since 2012.  OpenVDMv2 - PortOffice is used by SOI to drive the real-time status page for the *R/V Falkor*  In addition to financial support the marine technician aboard *R/V Falkor* and SOI's shoreside support staff continue to prove themselves invaluable to the development process by identifying on OpenVDMv2 - PortOffice's deficiencies and providing ways to improve functionality.

I also want to thank the UNOLS community who have helped me since the beginning by sharing their wealth of experience and technical ability.
