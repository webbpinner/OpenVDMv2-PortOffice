# OpenVDMv2-PortOffice v2.2
OpenVDMv2 - Port Office is the shore-side component of OpenVDMv2.  It's purpose is to provide shore-side personnel with a elegant interface and rich end-user experience to the data managed by OpenVDMv2.  This includes access to the data visualizations, maps, data quality test results and data file statistics.

In addition to showing these insights into the current cruise, OpenVDMv2 - Port Office can also show users the same information from previous cruises, allowing users to discover trends in sensor performance.

As with OpenVDMv2, Port Office also includes a full RESTful API, allowing vessel operators to built their own custom web-based and stand-alone applications that leverage information stored within OpenVDMv2 - Port Office for their own, vessel-specific needs.
